Note :- Screenshot of output 7.2(a) and 7.2(b) attached.
        for rest others I have tried the command was working fine but was getting connectionrefused error,So could not     		take the screenshot. 

 






























STORE emp_filter into '/pigresult'; //put into hdfs 

Solve intermediates results
log = LOAD '/sample.log';

LEVELS = foreach log generate REGEX_EXTRACT($0,'(TRACE|DEBUG|INFO|WARN|ERROR|FATAL)',1) as LOGLEVEL;

FILTEREDLEVELS = FILTER LEVELS by LOGLEVEL is not null;

GROUPEDLEVELS = GROUP FILTERLEVELS by LOGLEVEL;

FREQUENCIES =foreach GROUPEDLEVELS generate group as LOGLEVEL, COUNT(FILTEREDLEVELS.LOGLEVEL) as COUNT;

RESULT = order FREQUENCIES by COUNT desc;

DUMP RESULT;
